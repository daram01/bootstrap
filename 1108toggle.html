                111A recently uncovered “policy reference” document by the Korean National Police Agency's intelligence bureau reveals the current point of view held by the ruling party, which is wary that responsibility for the Itaewon disaster will be pinned on the government.
                The document cited references made by progressive groups, such as comparing the current situation to the poor response by the government during the Sewol ferry disaster and the government’s focus on wanting to influence public opinion in its favor. The document also stated that this could even lead to a movement calling for the administration to step down.
                Lee Sang-min, minister of the interior and safety, referred to criticism regarding the absence of police forces at Itaewon as “agitating, political arguments” while Chung Jin-suk, interim leader of the ruling People Power Party, said that the time right after the Itaewon disaster was not a time for questioning or interrogations but for commemorating the deceased. Similarly, ruling party lawmaker Kweon Seong-dong said that “sadness should not be spread through partisan anger.”
                All these statements are in line with denouncing the current fact-finding probe as a political dispute.
